# Blaseball Weather Sat
A twitter bot that posts weather forecasts for [blaseball](https://www.blaseball.com/). It can be seen in action at [twitter.com/BlaseWeatherSat](https://twitter.com/BlaseWeatherSat). I run this bot on a raspberry pi and trigger it with a cronjob that activates every 20 minutes.

The Blaseball Weather Sat is currently offline due to being destroyed in the events of season 24 but it will return.
